# 256-bit-SRAM
256-BIT SRAM Memory System was designed using 8T cell using 65nm technology on Cadence Virtuoso schematic editor.

It was designed such that parameters like area can be minimized while working at the maximum possible frequency. 
Using a 4-to-8 decoder, the SRAM array is accessed by a 4-bit address. The SRAM cells are designed to achieve lowest 
power consumption and suitable for working at the maximum possible frequency, while operating at 1.5GHz Read & Write 
cycles & it works on supply of 880mV (~1V). The test-bench, the implementation, and the layout of the SRAM array and 
the decoder are done using software simulations through Cadence Virtuosoâ€™s Analog-Design Environment (ADE).
